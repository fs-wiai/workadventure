    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>It has been far too long since your last physical stay here. Have a look at what changed in the meantime. To move around, use the arrow keys. Shift allows you to gather some speed.</p>

    <p>You will surely encounter some friends along the way. When you approach them, you will be able to talk to up to three of them in a video call. In some rooms, you can have an open discussion with an almost unlimited number of people. We marked these with a special symbol.</p>

    <h2>These are the rules:</h2>

    <p>To maintain our university's welcoming and open atmosphere, we demand you to follow some guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Who built this?</h2>

    <p>The ERBA part of our UniAdventure is a project by Fachschaft WIAI in cooperation with enthusiastic individuals. If you would like to become part of the project, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/fs-wiai/wiai-home">our Github repository</a> or drop us a message (<a href="mailto:fachschaft-wiai.stuve@uni-bamberg.de">via email</a> or in our virtual register above).</p>

    <p>Also, check out the wonderful <a href="https://workadventu.re">Workadventure project</a> providing the game engine that runs our map.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of places to discover at the ERBA island. Look out for signs on the floor and curious objects. And now, let's go for a stroll!</p>
