    <h1>Printing and Scanning</h1>

    <p>You can use the two print stations on ERBA island with the help of your student card. Simply submit the files you want to print to <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/campusprint/drucken/">campusprint</a>, the university's remote printing application. It is also available as a <a href="https://campusprint.uni-bamberg.de">web application</a>. Both of them can be utilized to scan documents, as well.</p>

    <p>To connect to campusprint, you will need access to the university network, either by being physically present in the building or via a <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/rz/dienstleistungen/netz/vpn/einrichten/">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a>.</p>

    <p>As opposed to scanning, printing obviously costs you a certain amount of credit from your student card, depending on the paper size, quality, and color configurations. Details can be found <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/medientechnik/kopieren-und-drucken/">here</a>. Although it is counter-intuitive, you should also have about 1,00 € of credit remaining in order to scan—which is free, nonetheless.</p>

    <p>Students can only use two printers on ERBA island: the one in the library and the one on the fourth floor (WE5/04.006). All of the other printers can only be accessed by staff members. If you are closer to a different university building, have a look at the <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/medientechnik/kopieren-und-drucken/">list of all printers</a>.</p>
